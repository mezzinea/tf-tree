## Generate a Terraform Graph (.dot)

From your Terraform project directory:

```bash
terraform init
terraform graph > graph.dot
```

This generates a Graphviz DOT file containing resource dependencies.

## How to Use

1. Open the UI  
   👉 https://mezzinea.github.io/tf-tree/

2. Upload one or more `.dot` files.

3. Select a graph from the dropdown.

4. Click any node to explore its dependencies.

5. Use search and zoom tools for navigation.

6. Use **Clear Highlight** to reset the view.
